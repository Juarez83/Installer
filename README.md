installer (see https://github.com/cspace-puppet instead)
=========

This repository contains prototype CollectionSpace installer code.

This code, for a Microsoft Windows installer, was developed by Robert Moskal
of Most Media, using the install4j tool.

You can find current work on installers for CollectionSpace server instances in
the cspace-puppet repository. These installers are being developed using an enterprise
configuration management tool, Puppet:
